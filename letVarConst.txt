1. let , var and const -->

let, var and const all are keywords used to declare the variables. And they differ significantely in terms
of scoping , initialization rules, Whether they can redclared or reassigned and the behaviour when they 
are accessed before declaration.

var --> 
1. var can take global or function level scope.
2. using var keyword function or variables can be hoisted means they can moved to the top of their
   containing scope during compile phase and if we access them they give us undefined.
3. variables declared using var keyword can be redclared.
4. variable declared using var keyword can be reassigned as well.

let -->
1. let takes the Block level scope only.
2. using let keyword function or variable can't be hoisted but if we access them then they give us 
   ReferenceError coz of temporal dead zone.(declaration are hoisted but not initialization)
   Until the declaration is reached,They are in temporal dead zone.
3. variables declared using let keyword can't be redclared.
4. variables declared using let keyword can be reassigned.

const -->

1. const takes the block level scope only.
2. using const keyword function or variables can't be hoisted  but if we try to access them then they give
   us ReferenceError.(declaration are hoisted but not initialization)
   Until the declaration is reached,They are in temporal dead zone.
3. variables declared using const keyword can't be redeclared.
4. variables declared using const keyword can't be reassigned.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


// During let,const case ... when we try to access the variable before declaration, It gives us 
   ReferenceError because of TDZ.

   console.log(x); // ❌ ReferenceError
   let x = 10;

  Here in this example, 

  First js does two things-- 1. Memory allocation phase - where it allocates the memory to the variable.
                               As they aren't initialized coz of that they go into TDZ.
                            2. Excuting phase - It excutes the code line by line.

    So, Now we know we have x but when we try to access x before declaration it gives us ReferenceError
    coz we are in temporal dead zone. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//During the var case -->

  console.log(x); // undefined
  var x = 10;

In first case js allocate the memory for x.
and immediately initialize with undefined.

So, when we access before declaration it gives us undefined.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why var don't go into TDZ like let and const?.
Before ES6, var was the only keyword to declare the variable and it was designed with function scoped 
behavior and automatic initialization undefined.
To maintain the backword compatibility, var variables are immediately initialize with undefined.

And in the case of let and const -->
let and const were introduced to fix the var's flwas...
var leads to confusing bugs due to hoisting and undefined behavior.

To make the let and const safer --
js introduces the TDZ, which forces us to declare the variable before using it otherwise will get 
ReferenceError, This makes code more predictable and easier to debug.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Difference between == and === ?
They both are used to perform the comparison == known as loose equality operator and === known as 
strict equality operator.
And the most basic Difference is that 
Loose equality(==) --> 1. Used to perform the implicit type conversion.
                       2. It compare the values after the type conversion if needed.
Strict equality operator(===) --> 
                       1. Doesn't perform the type conversion.
                       2. It compares the value and type both without any type conversion.
                       3. Value and type both must match.


// Now we should get the question, That if js doesn't know the type of values then how it converts?
Js does know types of every value, Its just that == doesn't require them to match before comparing .
Instead, It uses the internal conversion rules to decide which value to convert and how, based on their types.                       

For example -->
    
    console.log('5'==5); //true

    left '5' -- string
    right 5  -- number

    So, Js says that, These types are different types, I will convert the string '5' into number implicitly.
    And then after that it will compare the values, coz now types are same.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Console.log('5'===5); //false

In this case, 1. It doesn't perform the type conversion here types are not same return false.
              2. No need for checking values here.


//Rules for === strict equality operator-->

1. If types aren't same return false immediately.
2. If types are same then --
                1. Checks the value if same return true.
                2. If not same then return the false.

    For example --> 
            console.log(5===10); //false

        Here, types are same (number === number)
        Now checks the value where (5 ===10) both values are different return false.
